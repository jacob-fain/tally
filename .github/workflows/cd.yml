      #
      # Option A: Railway (recommended for simplicity)
      #   Railway can auto-deploy directly from GitHub without this step.
      #   1. Go to Railway → New Project → Deploy from GitHub Repo
      #   2. Select this repo and main branch
      #   3. Railway will auto-deploy on every push to main
      #   4. Set env vars in Railway dashboard (DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, etc.)
      #
      # Option B: Render
      #   Same as Railway - connect GitHub repo, Render auto-deploys.
      #   Or use their deploy hook URL with the step below.
      #
      # Option C: Fly.io
      #   Uncomment the flyctl step below and add FLY_API_TOKEN secret.

      # - name: Deploy to Fly.io
