# Tally

A Windows desktop app for tracking daily habits over the course of a year. Set your habits, check them off each day, and get a full-year view of your consistency and progress.

## The Idea

I wanted a simple way to hold myself accountable on daily goals — things like no soda, no TikTok, working out, reading, etc. At the end of the year, I want to see exactly how many days I stuck with each habit and where I fell off. A year-long heatmap view makes it easy to spot streaks, gaps, and overall trends at a glance.

## Features (Planned)

- **Custom Habits** — add as many daily habits as you want
- **Daily Check-Off** — mark each habit as done or not done for the current day
- **Year View** — full calendar-year heatmap for each habit (think GitHub contribution graph)
- **Stats** — total days completed, current streak, longest streak, completion percentage
- **Persistent Data** — all progress saved locally between sessions
- **Windows Installer** — packaged as a proper desktop app with an installer

## Stretch Goals

- Edit past days (forgot to check off yesterday)
- Categories or grouping for habits
- Daily notes or journal entries
- Export stats to CSV or image
- Dark mode
- Notifications or reminders

## Tech Stack

_TBD — exploring options (Electron, Tauri, WPF, WinUI, etc.)._

## Getting Started

_Coming soon._
